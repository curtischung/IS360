            <h3>My Favorite Games</h3>
            <p>
                For me, it is a little hard to choose my all time Favorite
                games that I have played. A few of my most memorable and fun
                experiences include, but not limited to:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hollow Knight</b></li>
                    <li><b>Genshin Impact</b></li>
                    <li><b>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</b></li>
                    <li>Escape from Tarkov</li>
                    <li>Battlefield</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Although I love my big titles,
                Indie Platformers and shooter games will have a favorite place in
                my gaming. If I had to pick an alltime favorite, it would definitely
                be Hollow Knight above all, especially in the platforming industry.

            <h3>Favorite Meals/Dishes</h3>
            <p>
                For me, if I go on vacation, the most important thing I have to care about is the food. 
                If the food is not good, the vacation/place is significantly less enjoyable than if there
                was good food and almost nothing else to do. I also enjoy cooking a lot, it's really fun to
                make delicious dishes and make other people smile in enjoyment of the good food that they
                are eating, especially when it's good food that I made. 

                Heres a fun list of my favorites and specifics of how I like to cook things. This is only
                stuff I could think of off the top of my head, and some recipes thrown down if you're into
                cooking and want to try it.
            </p>
